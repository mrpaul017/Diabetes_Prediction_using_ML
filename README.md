# Diabetes Prediction using ML with Deployment
![pexels-wdnet-1001897](https://github.com/mrpaul017/Diabetes_Prediction_using_ML/assets/145193843/d54a888c-0444-4a2b-95e7-4afc0e0bff05)

I made a predictor for Diabetes using relevant diagnostic information. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

## Diagnostic measurements to predict the 'Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)' are :
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)

## Steps in the making of this prediction system:
- Import libraries and dataset
- Analyzing the dataset
- Applying various models
- Choosing the best model
- Saving the model
- Deployment using Streamlit
